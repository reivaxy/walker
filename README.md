 # Walking man laser zoetrope


I was very impressed with this 3D printed zoetrope:

So I wondered if I could design something more within my reach, because that structure really is too complex for me to replicate :)

Here is the result, which is not as impressive but nice enough.

It's modular, you can easily dismantle it. Also, there is no glue involved, everything holds together (more or less) because it's tightly adjusted.

You can easily replace the 32 blades to make a different animation.

The marche*.png files have indications of support parts that should be painted black.

On this little video I had not painted all the top horizontal rods in black, so it kinda looks like a laser beam is going from the left walking guy to the right walking guy :)

To insure fluidity I have used two UEETEK 624ZZ 4mm x 13mm x 5mm bearings.

For the laser, I have used this (on the red laser video)

For the blue laser video I've simply put a lens in front of a blue laserpen. I'll design a lens holder for laserpens.

Next steps: add a little motor, and a laser led support.
